The data selected for this file come Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0. The data has been read to R, multipe files have been combine, re-organised and summarised with run_analysis.R script. The script combines train and test datasets, extracts columns containing mean and standard deviations for the measured paramtes. The extracted data is summarised by calculation mean for each column value for each activity and each subject. The function of the script is futher explained inthe README.txt and the code is also heavily commented.

The variable names have been simpliefied and made tidy to simplify data handling when compared to original dataset. The experiments and details for the original dataset are futher described in the features_info.txt and README.txt which are available with the original data set https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip . 

subject column contains identification number for the test subject, range 1-30. 
activity colum contains text label for the activity with values: WALKING; WALKING_UPSTAIRS; WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS; SITTING; STANDING; LAYING

Other columns contain average values for the measurements summarised for for each activity and each subject.

The file has following columns:
